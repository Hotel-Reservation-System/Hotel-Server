INTRODUCTION TO THE HOTEL RESERVATION SYSTEM PROJECT (HRSP)

CHALLENGE: Hotel Reservation System - Create a reservation system which books hotel rooms. 
It charges various rates for particular rooms of the hotel. Example, hotel rooms have 
penthouse suites which cost more. Keep track of when rooms will be available and can be 
scheduled.


TODO: Write an introduction to the major concepts and frameworks of this project.

1. Introduce the Hotel Reservation System Project and its component programs: Hotel-Client,
Hotel-Server and Common. Explain their breakdown (

2. Introduce these concepts: ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, Migrations, Application server, 
MVC architecture etc. Explain them and connect them holistically.    

This project encapsulates the Data Access Layer and the Controllers of the Hotel Reservation
System Project. It is an ASP.NET Core WebAPI project intended to be a standalone program that 
runs on a server. This project's intended client is the Hotel-Client project, but it is designed
to be language and program agnostic. In other words, Hotel-Server can talk to clients besides 
Hotel-Client, even if they are written in other languages.

TODO: INCORPORATE AND REWRITE THIS BLOCK TO EXPLAIN HOTEL-SERVER'S ROLL AS AN APP SERVER.

      Application Server: is the server program portion of an application that is divided
      into a multi-tier architecture, as is the case for this project. The application 
      server for this project is called 'Hotel-Server'. An application server is an
      environment that provides all the runtime services your application needs. It hosts
      and exposes the business logic of your application to the client through APIs.

      The FRONT-END of a multi-tier application is also called the Presentation layer. It
      presents a UI to the user, by which the user issues commands to the application. The
      front-end can be a client application that runs on the users computer, but its equally
      likely to be Web-browser based. The front-end for this project is called 'Hotel-Client'.

      The middle tier of the application, called the APPLICATION SERVER, contains the
      business logic layer of the application. It sits between the front-end and the backend,
      acting as the intermediary between the database and the users of the application.
      The front-end and back-end talk to the application server via protocols and APIs.
      Application servers usually extend the capabilities of a web server by either 
      encompassing or being paired with a web server. Application servers usually run on
      the user's computer and but they can also run on servers. 

      The last tier, the BACK-END, is the database and transaction layer. It handles
      communications with the database. Backends usually run on server machines. The
      backend for this project is called 'Hotel-Server'.


Hotel-Server is partially structured in the MVC pattern. Specifically, it gets Models (M) from
the Common project and implements Controllers (C). As it is a WebAPI project, it should not and
does not have Views (V) implemented. That is the business of the Hotel-Client project. See below
for a discussion about this architecture.

This project has a lot of notes that are essential to learning how this project is structured
and how it operates. Topics include: How the MVC architecture works, Database Setup,
Database Providers, Data Models, the Schema, Migrations, Controllers, Endpoints, REST
architecture, HTTP Requests, Route Variables and more. Read the notes in this order:

    1. WHAT IS MVC?:                    MVC Architecture.txt (Hotel-Server folder)
    2. DATABASE SETUP AND CONCEPTS:     Database Setup.txt (Hotel-Server folder)
    3. ALL ABOUT MIGRATIONS:            Migrations.txt (Migrations folder)
    4. CONTROLLERS & ENDPOINTS:         HotelController.cs (Controllers folder)

INTRODUCTION TO ASP.NET CORE

"ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern,
cloud-based, Internet-connected applications. With ASP.NET Core, you can:

    Build web apps and services, IoT apps, and mobile backends.
    Use your favorite development tools on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    Deploy to the cloud or on-premises.
    Run on .NET Core or .NET Framework."[1]


SOLUTION STRUCTURE

The Properties folder comes with a 'launchsettings.json' file. This file contains all settings
the project needs to launch the application. Things like the settings for the server (IIS,
Kestrel etc.), Environment Variable settings (Development, Production etc.), Project settings
as well as your Application's URL are declared here. At launch time, the program will consult
this file and load the program as defined here.

The wwwroot folder is treated as the root folder of your website. This means that
http://yourDomainName.com/ points to this folder. Any files in your web application that are
client facing, such as HTML, CSS JavaScript and Image files, should be put into wwwroot or
one of its subfolders. Files in wwwroot are whitelisted by the server for serving up to 
anyone who requests it. Note that the core code for your web application should not be made
available to the web (via wwwroot). C# code, Razor pages and configuration files should NOT 
sit in wwwroot.

The Dependencies folder contains all the packages being used by this web application. Right now,
this consists of Nuget packages for server-side dependencies and Bower packages for client-side
dependencies.

In 'Solution Explorer' if you right-click 'Hotel-Server' and unload it, you can then choose to
'Edit Hotel-Server.csproj' file. A .csproj file is where packages and dependencies for a
project are declared:

    1. TargetFramework: sets the version number of .NET Core and ASP.NET Core. This project sets
       the value to 'netcoreapp2.0'. You can also right-click the project, go to 'Properties'
       and edit these value in the 'Project Properties' window.

    2. Nuget Packages: In the .csproj file, you can declare the dependencies you'll need in 
       your project and their version numbers. Usually, you don't have to hand edit this file;
       you add packages with the 'Nuget Package Manager' or 'Package Manager Console' and
       it will automatically update the .csproj file. However, if you choose it, you can declare
       dependencies by hand and Nuget will automatically download and install them to the
       project when you save the .csproj file.
