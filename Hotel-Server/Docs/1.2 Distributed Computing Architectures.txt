Then the arcticle will move on to examining architectures that are well suited to web 
applications:


    1. Distributed Computing and an Introduction to DC Architectures
    2. A 2-Tier Distributed Architecture: The Client-Server Model
    3. A 3+ Tier Distributed Architecture: Multitier/N-Tier
    4. An Architectural Pattern for Interactive Systems: Model-View-Controller (MVC)


Finally, after discussing distributed computing architectures and the MVC pattern, I will
analyze and discuss the structure and architecture, and architectural patterns used in 
Hotel-Reservation-System.
