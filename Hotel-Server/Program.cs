/* ARCHITECTURE OF THE HOTEL-SERVER PROJECT
 *
 * This project encapsulates the Data Access Layer and the Controllers of the Hotel Reservation
 * System Project. It is an ASP.NET Core WebAPI project intended to be a standalone program that 
 * runs on a server. This project's intended client is the Hotel-Client project, but it is designed
 * to be language and program agnostic. In other words, Hotel-Server can talk to clients besides 
 * Hotel-Client, even if they are written in other languages.
 *
 * Hotel-Server is partially structured in the MVC pattern. Specifically, it gets Models (M) from
 * the Common project and implements Controllers (C). As it is a WebAPI project, it should not and
 * does not have Views (V) implemented. That is the business of the Hotel-Client project. See below
 * for a discussion about this architecture.
 *
 * This project has a lot of notes that are essential to learning how this project is structured
 * and how it operates. Topics include: How the MVC architecture works, Database Setup,
 * Data Providers, Data Models, the Schema, Migrations, Controllers, Endpoints, REST architecture, 
 * HTTP Requests, Route Variables and more. Read the notes in this order:
 * 
 *     1. WHAT IS MVC?:                    MVC Architecture.txt (Hotel-Server folder)
 *     2. DATABASE SETUP AND CONCEPTS:     Database Setup.txt (Hotel-Server folder)
 *     3. ALL ABOUT MIGRATIONS:            Migrations.txt (Migrations folder)
 *     4. CONTROLLERS & ENDPOINTS:         HotelController.cs (Controllers folder)

 * INTRODUCTION TO ASP.NET CORE
 * 
 * "ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern,
 * cloud-based, Internet-connected applications. With ASP.NET Core, you can:
 * 
 *      * Build web apps and services, IoT apps, and mobile backends.
 *      * Use your favorite development tools on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
 *      * Deploy to the cloud or on-premises.
 *      * Run on .NET Core or .NET Framework."[1]

 * Please note that both Program.cs and Startup.cs were auto-generated when this WebAPI project was
 * created. Program.cs contains the Main() method, which boots up the server. Startup.cs defines a
 * boot object used in Program.cs.
